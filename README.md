# Brainfuck Python Transpiler

Repo contains brainfuck transpilers written in python for the following languages:

* Python
* Rust

## What the code in this repo _will_ do:

* Convert given brainfuck code to the above languages and dump the code in the target directory.
* Give you almost no indication why something went wrong.

## What the code in this repo _won't_ do:

* Actually make the code runable.

> If you choose Rust, or any language I add in the future that requires compiling, it will not do the compiling for you, it will simply spit out the source code into the target folder and you can compile it from there either with gcc, rustc, or any other relevant compiler.
